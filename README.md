# Mind Bender Trivia App (A React Project)

A trivia game app that brings in random trivia questions from a third party API. Built with React, Javascript & CSS.

Users can select a category and then answer 4 trivia questions in that category. When the user selects their response, the trivia card will show both the user response and the correct response. Additional trivia questions may be requested from any category.

## Project Notes

This is the first React app I've built from scratch. The goal of this project was to cement my understanding of React. It was a big learning curve, but I was able to successfully complete the project. Rendering the trivia cards the way I wanted them to render was challenging due to the way the API data came back.

The app is responsive and mobile friendly. The app design is pretty basic, which was intentional, because the goal was to really work on React and not focus too much on CSS.

This app was made using the `create-react-app` template to minimize the initial setup and allow me to focus on the React code, as this is the first React app I've built on my own.
